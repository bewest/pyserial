pySerial
--------
This module capsulates the access for the serial port. It provides backends
for standard Python running on Windows, Linux, BSD (possibly any POSIX
compilant system) and Jython. The module named "serial" automaticaly selects
the appropriate backend.

It is released under a free software license, see LICENSE.txt for more
details.

Features
--------
- same class based interface on all supported platforms
- port numbering starts at zero, no need to know the platform dependant port
  name in the user program
- port name can be specified if access through numbering is inappropriate
- support for different bytesizes, stopbits, parity and flow control
  with RTS/CTS and/or xon/xoff
- working with or without receive timeout, blocking or non-blocking
- file like API with "read" and "write" ("readline" etc. also supported)
- The files in this package are 100% pure Python.
  They depend on non standard but common packages on Windows (win32all) and
  Jython (JavaComm). POSIX (Linux, BSD) uses only modules from the standard
  python distribution)
- The port is set up for binary transmission. No NULL byte stripping, CR-LF
  translation etc. (which are many times enabled for POSIX.) This makes this
  module universally useful.


Requirements
------------
- Python 2.0 or newer (1.5.2 untested)
- win32all extensions on Windows
- "Java Communications" (JavaComm) extension for Java/Jython


Installation
------------
Extract files from the archive, open a shell/console in that directory and
let Disutils do the rest: "python setup.py install"

The files get installed in the "Lib/site-packages" directory in newer
Python versions.


Short introduction
------------------
Open port 0 at 9600,8,N,1, no timeout
>>> import serial
>>> ser = serial.Serial(0)  #open first serial port
>>> print ser.portstr       #check which port was realy used
>>> ser.write("hello")      #write a string
>>> ser.close()             #close port

Open named port at 19200,8,N,1, 1s timeout
>>> ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyS1', 19200, timeout=1)
>>> x = ser.read()          #read one byte
>>> s = ser.read(10)        #read up to ten bytes (timeout)
>>> line = ser.readline()   #read a \n terminated line
>>> ser.close()

Open second port at 38400,8,E,1, non blocking HW handshaking
>>> ser = serial.Serial(1, 38400, timeout=0,
...                     parity=serial.PARITY_EVEN, rtscts=1)
>>> s = ser.read(100)       #read up to one hunded bytes
...                         #or as much is in the buffer

Be carefully when using "readline". Do specify a timeout when
opening the serial port otherwise it could block forever if
no newline character is received. Also note that "readlines" only
works with a timeout. "readlines" depends on having a timeout
and interprets that as EOF (end of file). It raises an exception
if the port is not opened correctly.


Parameters for the Serial class
-------------------------------
ser = serial.Serial(
    port,                   #number of device, numbering starts at
                            #zero. if everything fails, the user
                            #can specify a device string, note
                            #that this isn't portable anymore
    baudrate=9600,          #baudrate
    bytesize=EIGHTBITS,     #number of databits
    parity=PARITY_NONE,     #enable parity checking
    stopbits=STOPBITS_ONE,  #number of stopbits
    timeout=None,           #set a timeout value, None for waiting forever
    xonxoff=0,              #enable software flow control
    rtscts=0,               #enable RTS/CTS flow control
)

The port is immediatley opened on object creation. Options:
timeout=None            # wait forever
timeout=0               #non-blocking mode (return immediately on read)
timeout=x               #set timeout to x seconds (float allowed)

Serial object Methods
---------------------
close()                 #close port immediately
setBaudrate(baudrate)   #change baudarte on an open port
inWaiting()             #return the number of chars in the receive buffer
read(size=1)            #read "size" characters
write(s)                #write the string to the port
flushInput()            #flush input buffer
flushOutput()           #flush output buffer
sendBreak()             #send break condition
setRTS(level=1)         #set RTS line to specified logic level
setDTR(level=1)         #set DTR line to specified logic level
getCTS()                #return the state of the CTS line
getDSR()                #return the state of the DSR line
getRI()                 #return the state of the RI line
getCD()                 #return the state of the CD line
