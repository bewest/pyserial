 pyParallel
============

.. note:: This module is in development (since years ;-)

Overview
========
This module encapsulates the access for the parallel port. It provides backends
for Python running on Windows and Linux. Other platforms are possible too but
not yet integrated.

This module is still under development. But it may be useful for developers.

.. _`SVN repository`: http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=46487


Features
--------
* same class based interface on all supported platforms
* port numbering starts at zero, no need to know the port name in the user program
* port string (device name) can be specified if access through numbering is inappropriate


Requirements
------------
* Python 2.2 or newer
* "Java Communications" (JavaComm) extension for Java/Jython


Installation
------------
Extract files from the archive, open a shell/console in that directory and let
Distutils do the rest: ``python setup.py install``

The files get installed in the "Lib/site-packages" directory in newer Python versions.

The windows version needs a compiled extension and the giveio.sys driver for
Windows NT/2k/XP. The extension module can be compiled with Distutils with
either MSVC or GCC/mingw32.

It is released under a free software license, see LICENSE.txt for more details.


Short introduction
==================
::

    >>> import parallel
    >>> p = parallel.Parallel()     # open LPT1
    >>> p.setData(0x55)


Examples
--------
Please look in the SVN Repository. There is an example directory where you can
find a simple terminal and more.

API
===

.. module:: parallel

.. class:: Parallel

    .. method:: __init__(port)

        Open given parallel port.

    .. method:: setData(value)

        Apply the given byte to the data pins of the parallel port.

    .. method:: setDataStrobe(level)

        Set the "data strobe" line to the given state.

    .. method:: setAutoFeed(level)

        Set "auto feed" line to given state.

    .. method:: setInitOut(level)

        Set "initialize" line to given state.

    .. method: setSelect(level)

        Set "select" line to given state.

    .. method:getInError()

        Set "Error" line to given state.

    .. method:: getInSelected()

        Read level of "select" line.

    .. method:: getInPaperOut()

        Read level of "paper out" line.

    .. method:: getInAcknowledge()

        Read level of "Acknowledge" line.

    .. method: getInBusy()

        Read level of "busy" line.


.. module:: parallel.parallelutil

.. class:: BitaccessMeta

    This mix-in class adds a few properties that allow easier bit access to the
    data lines. (D0 .. D7) e.g. p.D0 refers to the first bit of the data
    lines.

.. class:: VirtualParallelPort

    This class provides a virtual parallel port implementation, useful
    for tests and simulations without real hardware.
