        :exception ValueError:
            Will be raised when parameter are out of range, e.g. baud rate, data bits.

        :exception SerialException:
            In case the device can not be found or can not be configured.


        The port is immediately opened on object creation, when a *port* is
        given. It is not opened when *port* is :const:`None` and a successive call
        to :meth:`open` will be needed.

        Possible values for the parameter *port*:

        - Number: number of device, numbering starts at zero.
        - Device name: depending on operating system. e.g. ``/dev/ttyUSB0``
          on GNU/Linux or ``COM3`` on Windows.

        Possible values for the parameter *timeout*:

        - ``timeout = None``:  wait forever
        - ``timeout = 0``:     non-blocking mode (return immediately on read)
        - ``timeout = x``:     set timeout to ``x`` seconds (float allowed)


    .. method:: open()

        Open port.

    .. method:: close()

    The following methods may raise :exc:`ValueError` when applied to a closed
    port.

        :param size: Number of bytes to read.
        :return: Bytes read from the port.

        Read *size* bytes from the serial port. If a timeout is set it may
        return less characters as requested. With no timeout it will block
        until the requested number of bytes is read.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.5
            Returns an instance of :class:`bytes` when available (Python 2.6
            and newer) and :class:`str` otherwiese.

        :param data: Data to send.
        :return: Number of bytes written.
        :exception SerialTimeoutException:

            exceeded.

        Write the string *data* to the port.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.5
            Accepts instances of :class:`bytes` and :class:`bytearray` when
            available (Python 2.6 and newer) and :class:`str` otherwiese.

    .. method:: inWaiting()

        Return the number of chars in the receive buffer.

        Send break condition. Timed, returns to idle state after given
        duration.

    .. method:: setBreak(level=True)

    Read-only attributes:

    .. attribute:: name

        Device name. This is always the device name even if the
        port was opened by a number. (Read Only).

    .. attribute:: portstr

        :deprecated: use :attr:`name` instead

    .. attribute:: BAUDRATES

        A list of valid baud rates. The list may be incomplete such that higher

    Platform specific methods.

    .. warning:: Programs using the following methods are not portable to other platforms!

    .. method:: nonblocking()

        :platform: Unix

        Configure the device for nonblocking operations. This can be useful if
        the port is used with ``select``.

    .. method:: fileno()

        :platform: Unix
        :return: File descriptor.

        Return file descriptor number for the port that is opened by this object.

    .. method:: setXON(level=True)

        :platform: Windows
        :param level: Set flow control state.

.. class:: SerialBase

    The following attributes are implemented as properties. They work with open
    and closed ports.

    .. attribute:: port

        Read or write port. When the port is already open, it will be closed
        and reopened with the new setting.

    .. attribute:: baudrate

        Read or write current baud rate setting.

    .. attribute:: bytesize

        Read or write current data byte size setting.

    .. attribute:: parity

        Read or write current parity setting.

    .. attribute:: stopbits

        Read or write current stop bit width setting.

    .. attribute:: timeout

        Read or write current read timeout setting.

    .. attribute:: writeTimeout

        Read or write current write timeout setting.

    .. attribute:: xonxoff

        Read or write current software flow control rate setting.

    .. attribute:: rtscts

        Read or write current hardware flow control setting.

    .. attribute:: dsrdtr

        Read or write current hardware flow control setting.

    .. attribute:: interCharTimeout

        Read or write current inter character timeout setting.

    The following constants are also provided:

    .. attribute:: BAUDRATES

        A tuple of standard baud rate values. The actual device may support more
        or less...

    .. attribute:: BYTESIZES

        A tuple of supported byte size values.

    .. attribute:: PARITIES

        A tuple of supported parity settings.

    .. attribute:: STOPBITS

        A tuple of supported stop bit settings.

    .. method:: readline(size=None, eol='\\n')

        :param size: Max number of bytes to read, ``None`` -> no limit.
        :param eol: The end of line character.

        Read a line which is terminated with end-of-line (*eol*) character
        (``\\n`` by default) or until timeout.

    .. method:: readlines(sizehint=None, eol='\\n')

        :param size: Ignored parameter.
        :param eol: The end of line character.

        Read a list of lines, until timeout. *sizehint* is ignored and only
        present for API compatibility with built-in File objects.

    .. method:: xreadlines(sizehint=None)

        Just calls :meth:`readlines` - here for compatibility.

    For compatibility with the :mod:`io` library are the following methods.

    .. method:: readable()

        :return: True
        .. versionadded:: 2.5

    .. method:: writable()

        :return: True
        .. versionadded:: 2.5

    .. method:: seekable()

        :return: False
        .. versionadded:: 2.5

    .. method:: readinto(b)

        :param b: bytearray or array instace
        :return: Number of byte read

        Read up to len(b) bytes into bytearray b and return the number of bytes read.

        .. versionadded:: 2.5

 
.. note::

    For systems that provide the :mod:`io` library (Python 2.6 and newer), the
    class :class:`Serial` will derrive from :class:`io.RawIOBase`. For all
    others from :class:`FileLike`.

.. class:: FileLike

    An abstract file like class. It is used as base class for :class:`Serial`.

    This class implements :meth:`readline` and :meth:`readlines` based on read
    and :meth:`writelines` based on write.  This class is used to provide the
    above functions for to Serial port objects.

    Note that when the serial port was opened with no timeout that
    :meth:`readline` blocks until it sees a newline (or the specified size is
    reached) and that :meth:`readlines` would never return and therefore
    refuses to work (it raises an exception in this case)!

    .. method:: writelines(sequence)

        Write a list of strings to the port.


    The following three methods are overridden in :class:`Serial`.

    .. method:: flush()

        Flush of file like objects. It's a no-op in this class, may be overridden.

    .. method:: read()

        Raises NotImplementedError, needs to be overridden by subclass.

    .. method:: write(data)

        Raises NotImplementedError, needs to be overridden by subclass.

    The following functions are implemented for compatibility with other
    file-like objects, however serial ports are not seekable.


    .. method:: seek(pos, whence=0)

        :exception IOError: always, as method is not supported on serial port

        .. versionadded:: 2.5

    .. method:: tell()

        :exception IOError: always, as method is not supported on serial port

        .. versionadded:: 2.5

    .. method:: truncate(self, n=None)

        :exception IOError: always, as method is not supported on serial port

        .. versionadded:: 2.5

    .. method:: isatty()

        :exception IOError: always, as method is not supported on serial port

        .. versionadded:: 2.5

    To be able to use the file like object as iterator for e.g. 
    ``for line in Serial(0): ...`` usage:

    .. method:: next()

        Return the next line by calling :meth:`readline`.

    .. method:: __iter__()

        Returns self.



Exceptions
==========

.. exception:: SerialException

    Base class for serial port exceptions.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.5
        Now derrives from :exc:`IOError` instead of :exc:`Exception`

.. exception:: SerialTimeoutException

    Exception that is raised on write timeouts.

Functions:

.. function:: device(number)

    :param number: Port number.
    :return: String containing device name.
    :deprecated: Use device names directly.

    Convert a port number to a platform dependent device name. Unfortunately
    this does not work well for all platforms; e.g. some may miss USB-Serial
    converters and enumerate only internal serial ports.

    The conversion may be made off-line, that is, there is no guarantee that
    the returned device name really exists on the system.
